# MessMatrix

  The Mess, is a software development team affiliated with the Spring 2019 Software Engineering course at the University of Mount Union. We are developing an application called "The Mess Matrix" which is a software that allows users to have protected password by utilizing a screen GUI that scrambles the letters in an array making shoulder surfing obsolete. If you have a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with Internet access and wish to protect your password, then the Mess Matrix is for you!
  
  The Mess Matrix is a tool that allows users to protect themselves against an observer trying to steal a password being typed into the keyboard during login.  A 3 x 3 matrix filled with random characters from [a – z], [A – Z], and [0 – 9] will be presented on the screen, and the user can refresh the display or confirm that his/her current password letter is on screen until the User completes his/her password and presses submit.  
 
 This project is written in Python and embedded in a webpage element where The Mess has created a GUI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Mess Matrix application has a file containing all the possible usernames and passwords along with an encryption file to store the User’s credentials safely.
